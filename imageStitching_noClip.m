function [panoImg] = imageStitching_noClip(img1, img2, H2to1)
%
% input
% Warps img2 into img1 reference frame using the provided warpH() function
% H2to1 - a 3 x 3 matrix encoding the homography that best matches the linear equation
%
% output
% Blends img1 and warped img2 and outputs the panorama image
%
% To prevent clipping at the edges, we instead need to warp both image 1 and image 2 into a common third reference frame 
% in which we can display both images without any clipping.
